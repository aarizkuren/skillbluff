# SkillBluff - OG Image Brief

## Project Context

**SkillBluff** is a satirical web app that generates "fake AI skills" for Claude Code. Users enter absurd prompts like "water my plants" or "organize my conspiracy theories" and the app generates professional-looking (but completely fake) MCP skill definitions in markdown format.

**Vibe:** Professional sarcasm, dark humor, cyberpunk aesthetics, "certified fake" authenticity.

## Technical Guidelines

### Do's ✅

- Test visibility at 300x157 (common preview size)

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't use light/white backgrounds (breaks the brand)
- Don't use generic AI aesthetics (avoid blue gradients, robot icons)
- Don't make text too small or detailed
- Don't use actual Anthropic/Claude logos (trademark issues)
- Don't overcrowd with too many elements
